## 🧭 **Project Overview**
**HappyGolf** is an **augmented reality (AR) golf training game** designed for **HoloLens 2**.  
Using **gaze**, **gesture**, and **voice** interactions, players can practice golf *anywhere and anytime*, adapting to **rainy, snowy, and windy** environments that simulate real-world challenges.  
<u>Core value:</u> Lower the barrier to entry for golf practice, increase accessibility, and help players build stable performance across changing conditions.

## 🧠 **Core Interactions**
- **Gaze** – Target objects and place the virtual landscape using voice commands (`"Select"` → `"Place"`).  
- **Voice** – Generate the golf club and ball (`"Club"` / `"Ball"`) or reset gameplay elements.  
- **Gesture** – Grab and swing the virtual club naturally using both-hand pinch gestures.<br>

**Instant feedback includes:**  
**Sound effects** (club-ball impact / hole score), **scoreboard**, **ball speed**, and **coach dialogue**.

## 🧩 **Prototyping Process**
**Iteration highlights:**  
- Early attempts with **Vuforia / QR tracking** → shifted to **native HoloLens inputs** for stability.  
- Developed a streamlined **voice command pipeline** (`Select → Place → Club / Ball`).  
- Added a **virtual coach (Mixamo)** as guide, feedback source, and menu interface.  
- Refined synchronization between **audio and animation**, prevented scaling bugs, and stabilized **mode transitions**.

## 🌦️ **Weather Simulation**
- **🌧️ Rainy Mode** – Raindrops blur the player’s view; ambient rain sound enhances immersion.  
- **❄️ Snowy Mode** – Increased ground friction reduces the ball’s rolling distance.  
- **🌬️ Windy Mode** – Wind gusts affect the ball’s trajectory and create falling leaves for visual feedback.  

> **Why weather?**  
> **Emphasis:** Training in multiple environments helps players strengthen **focus**, **control**, and **adaptive decision-making**.
