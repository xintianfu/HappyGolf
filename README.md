## üß≠ **Project Overview**
**HappyGolf** is an **augmented reality (AR) golf training game** designed for **HoloLens 2**.  
Using **gaze**, **gesture**, and **voice** interactions, players can practice golf *anywhere and anytime*, adapting to **rainy, snowy, and windy** environments that simulate real-world challenges.  
<u>Core value:</u> Lower the barrier to entry for golf practice, increase accessibility, and help players build stable performance across changing conditions.

## üéÆ **Game Modes**
- **Practice Mode** ‚Äì Learn the basic controls and environment in clear weather.  
- **Weather Mode** ‚Äì Train under challenging **üåßÔ∏è rain**, **‚ùÑÔ∏è snow**, or **üå¨Ô∏è wind** to build focus and adaptability.  

> ***Design insight:*** By introducing controllable environmental difficulty, the game helps players develop <ins>anticipation</ins> and <ins>emotional stability</ins> through repeated, contextualized practice.

## üß† **Core Interactions**
- **Gaze** ‚Äì Target objects and place the virtual landscape using voice commands (`"Select"` ‚Üí `"Place"`).  
- **Voice** ‚Äì Generate the golf club and ball (`"Club"` / `"Ball"`) or reset gameplay elements.  
- **Gesture** ‚Äì Grab and swing the virtual club naturally using both-hand pinch gestures.  

**Instant feedback includes:**  
**Sound effects** (club-ball impact / hole score), **scoreboard**, **ball speed**, and **coach dialogue**.

## üß© **Prototyping Process**
**Iteration highlights:**  
- Early attempts with **Vuforia / QR tracking** ‚Üí shifted to **native HoloLens inputs** for stability.  
- Developed a streamlined **voice command pipeline** (`Select ‚Üí Place ‚Üí Club / Ball`).  
- Added a **virtual coach (Mixamo)** as guide, feedback source, and menu interface.  
- Refined synchronization between **audio and animation**, prevented scaling bugs, and stabilized **mode transitions**.

## üå¶Ô∏è **Weather Simulation**
- **üåßÔ∏è Rainy Mode** ‚Äì Raindrops blur the player‚Äôs view; ambient rain sound enhances immersion.  
- **‚ùÑÔ∏è Snowy Mode** ‚Äì Increased ground friction reduces the ball‚Äôs rolling distance.  
- **üå¨Ô∏è Windy Mode** ‚Äì Wind gusts affect the ball‚Äôs trajectory and create falling leaves for visual feedback.  

> **Why weather?**  
> **Emphasis:** Training in multiple environments helps players strengthen **focus**, **control**, and **adaptive decision-making**.
