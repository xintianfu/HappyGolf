# HappyGolf

HappyGolf is an augmented reality (AR) golf training game designed for the Microsoft HoloLens 2.
The project aims to make golf practice more accessible, immersive, and adaptable, allowing players to train anywhere and anytime without the spatial limitations of a real golf course.
Through the combination of gaze, gesture, and voice input, HappyGolf provides an intuitive and engaging way for players to improve focus, precision, and adaptability â€” even under changing virtual weather conditions.
